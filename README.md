# WILL GENERATOR TOOL

This application is a Dynamic Will Generation Tool designed to simplify the process of creating a last will and testament through a user-friendly web interface.

## Application Flow Overview:
The application is a multi-step form that guides the user through entering various details required for a will. Once all information is collected, it uses Puppeteer to generate the will's content into a downloadable PDF.

### Detailed Flow
## 1. Initialization and State Setup :
-  It initializes various state variables using useState hooks:
- testatorDetails: Holds the personal information of the will creator.
- beneficiaries: An array to store details of each beneficiary.
- bankAccounts, insurancePolicies, stocks, mutualFunds, jewellery, house, land: Arrays to store details for different types of assets.
- executors: Stores information about the primary and alternate executors.
- guardianInfo: Stores details for the guardianship clause (wife's name, guardian's name, children's names).
- currentStep: Tracks the active step in the multi-step form (starts at 0).
- loading: A boolean to indicate if the PDF generation process is ongoing.

## 2. Multi-Step Form Navigation :
- The UI displays a progress bar and clickable step titles at the top, allowing users to see their progress and navigate between sections.
- "Next" and "Previous" buttons are rendered at the bottom of each step (except the first and last, respectively).
- Clicking these buttons updates the currentStep state, which in turn conditionally renders the relevant form section.

## 3. Review & Generate Will :
- This is the final step where all the collected data is displayed for review.
- A "Generate Will PDF" button is present.
## 4. PDF Generation (Backend) :
- EJS Template Rendering:
    - The backend will use ejs.renderFile to dynamically generate HTML content.
    - It will load an EJS template file (e.g., willTemplate.ejs), which contains the structure and placeholders for the will.
- Puppeteer for PDF Generation:
    - A headless Puppeteer browser instance is launched (puppeteer.launch). This means a browser runs in the background without a visible UI.
    - A new page is created in this browser (browser.newPage()).
    - The HTML generated by EJS is set as the content of this Puppeteer page (page.setContent(html, { waitUntil: "networkidle0" })). networkidle0 ensures all network requests for resources (like fonts, images) are complete before PDF generation.
    - The page is then converted into a PDF (page.pdf({ format: "A4" })).
    - The Puppeteer browser is closed (browser.close()).
    - res.send(pdf) sends the binary PDF data
